**In HTML, we can change the color of any text using the following different ways:**

* Using HTML tag
* Using an Inline style attribute
* Using internal CSS

## 1. Using HTML tag

If we want to change the color of a text using Html tag which is to be displayed on a web page, we have to follow the steps which are given below. Using these steps, we can easily change the color of any text:

Step 1. Firstly, we have to type the Html code in any text editor or open the existing Html
file in the text editor in which we want to use the Html tag

Step 2. Now, move the cursor at the starting of that text whose color we want to change. And then, type the empty Html <font> tag at that position.

Step 3. Then, we have to close the font tag at the end of the text whose color we want to change.

Step 4. Now, we have to add the attribute of the font tag whose name is "color". So, type the color attribute within the starting <font> tag. And, then we have to give the color which we want to use on the text. So, type the name of color in the color attribute as described in the following block.

Step 5. And, at last, we have to save the Html code in the text editor and run the code. After execution, we will see the output in the browser. The following screenshot shows the output of the above Html Code:

Step 2. Now, move the cursor at the starting of that text whose color we want to change. And then, type the inline style attribute within any element. Here, we use the <p> (paragraph) tag:

Step 3. In this step, we have to give a name of color as a value. We can give the color name in three forms:

    * We can type the name of a color
    * We can also enter the RGB value of a color
    * We can also enter the hexadecimal value of a color.
Step 4. Then, we have to close the element at the end of the text whose color we want to change.
Step 5. And, at last, save the Html code which changes the text color using the CSS
style attribute.



## 2. Using Internal CSS

If we want to change the color of a text using an internal cascading stylesheet which is to be displayed on a web page, we have to follow the steps which are given below. Using these steps, we can easily change the color of text.

Step 1. Firstly, we have to type the Html code in any text editor or open the existing Html file in the text editor in which we want to use the internal CSS
for changing the color of a text.

Step 2. Now, we have to place the cursor in the head tag of the Html document and then define the styles inside the <style> tag as shown in the following block. And, then type the color attribute into the element selector.

Step 3. Now, we have to type the defined element selector before the text whose color we want to change.
